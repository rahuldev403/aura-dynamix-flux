# Aura Dynamics - Futuristic Drone & Hardware Platform

**Welcome to the repository for the Aura Dynamics website, a conceptual single-page frontend built to showcase a cutting-edge robotics and hardware brand. This project is a masterclass in modern web animation and interactive design, created to push the boundaries of user experience with a dark, futuristic aesthetic inspired by top-tier gaming and tech brands like ASUS ROG and NVIDIA.**

**This project was developed as a single-file React application, making it highly portable and easy to integrate into hackathon submissions or larger projects.**

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

**This website is not just a static page; it's an immersive "scrollytelling" experience designed to captivate users.**

* **Cinematic Pre-loader:** An intricate, animated sequence that assembles the company logo before revealing the main content.
* **Advanced GSAP Scrollytelling:**
  * **Hero Section Transition:** The hero scene is pinned on scroll, smoothly shrinking and transitioning into the next section.
  * **Product Assembly Scene:** An interactive sequence where users scrub through an animation of a product assembling itself as they scroll.
* **Mouse-Reactive Interactivity:**
  * **3D Parallax Effects:** Elements in the hero section and on UI cards react to the user's mouse position to create a sense of depth.
  * **Magnetic Buttons:** Call-to-action buttons subtly pull towards the cursor, enhancing user engagement.
  * **Custom Cursor:** A custom-designed cursor that changes state when hovering over interactive elements.
* **Advanced Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern glass effect with `<span class="selected">backdrop-blur</span>` and subtle, mouse-aware gradient borders is used on cards and the navigation bar.
* **Fluid UI Animations with Framer Motion:** Component-level interactions, hover effects, and physics-based carousels are handled by Framer Motion for a smooth, natural feel.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:** An animated and interactive graph built with Recharts to showcase market data.
* **Fully Responsive Design:** The entire experience is meticulously crafted to look and perform beautifully on all devices, from mobile phones to ultra-wide desktop monitors.
